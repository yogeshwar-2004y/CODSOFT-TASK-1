Here's a basic outline of how you can accomplish each step:

HTML Structure:
Start by creating the basic HTML structure for your task list application. You'll need elements to display the tasks, input fields to add new tasks, buttons for editing and deleting tasks, etc.
Style with CSS:
Use CSS to style your task list application. You can apply colors, fonts, spacing, and layout to make it visually appealing.
JavaScript Functionality:
Implement JavaScript to add functionality to your task list. You'll need to write code to:
Add tasks: Capture input from the user and add it to the list of tasks.
Edit tasks: Allow users to edit task descriptions inline.
Delete tasks: Provide a way for users to remove tasks from the list.
Local Storage:
To save tasks locally, you can use the browser's localStorage API. Store the tasks whenever they're added, edited, or deleted, and retrieve them when the page loads.
